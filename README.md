# CNN-Based Classification of Viral Pneumonia, Normal, and Covid Conditions from Medical Images

This repository contains code for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based classification project aimed at distinguishing between viral pneumonia, normal, and Covid conditions using medical images.

## Overview

In this project, a CNN model is implemented and trained to classify medical images into three categories:
- Viral Pneumonia
- Normal
- Covid

The CNN architecture leverages deep learning techniques to extract features from medical images, enabling accurate classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of medical images annotated with one of the three classes mentioned above. The dataset may be sourced from Kaggle.

## Implementation

The implementation uses Python and TensorFlow/Keras, utilizing the `ImageDataGenerator` for data augmentation and labelling. This approach enhances the robustness and generalization of the CNN model by generating variations of the training images and automatically assigning labels.

### Key Components:

1. **Data Augmentation**: The `ImageDataGenerator` is used to perform real-time data augmentation during training. Techniques such as rotation, horizontal/vertical shifting, zooming, and flipping are applied to create additional training examples.

2. **Model Architecture**: The CNN architecture is designed to effectively learn and differentiate between the three classes of medical conditions. It typically includes convolutional layers for feature extraction followed by fully connected layers for classification.

3. **Training**: The model is trained on the augmented dataset using an appropriate loss function and optimizer. The training process involves iterating over batches of augmented images generated by the `ImageDataGenerator`.

4. **Evaluation**: After training, the model is evaluated on a separate test set to assess its performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. **Deployment**: Optionally, guidelines or scripts for deploying the trained model for inference may be included.



6. Customize hyperparameters, model architecture, or dataset as needed for further experimentation.
